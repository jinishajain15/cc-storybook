        # Getting Started Guide for Designers
    </div>

    The brand identity and user interface elements of TruShield are communicated using the TruShield Insurance Design System.
    TruShield user interfaces come in a wide variety to match their functions, from applications for specific services to creative websites.
    Using a core set of components, modules, and animations, the goal is to develop solutions that offer a well-balanced, system-wide user experience.
    The cornerstone for all user interface designs made for TruShield's digital suite of products is the TruShield Design Kit, which includes the fundamental elements and
    tokens that can be used. How to install the TruShield Design Kit and use it in your project is explained in the Getting Started Guide provided on this page.
