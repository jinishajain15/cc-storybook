    **Things to keep in mind:**
    1. To maintain consistency and professionalism, try not to distort the size and shape of our logos. Using tools like "Format Picture" options or holding "Shift" when resizing an image can help. For more detailed guidelines, check out our logo style guide below.
    2. Our full-colour logo can be used on a white background. If you're using our logo on a colour other than white, use the black or white version.

    <div class="sub-heading">
        ## Co-branded Logo Clearance
    </div>
    Co-branded logos are used to represent partnerships between TruShield Insurance and other companies. These logos should be used in conjunction with the TruShield Insurance logo and should not be used on their own. The following guidelines should be followed when using co-branded logos:
    + The TruShield Insurance logo should always be the same size or larger than the co-branded logo.
    + The co-branded logo should be placed to the right of the TruShield Insurance logo and should be aligned to the bottom of the TruShield Insurance logo.

    **Ideal minimum clearance**

    To ensure that logos are clearly visible, surround them with clear space that is free of type, graphics, and other elements that might cause
    visual clutter.

    Use the square in the middle of the “shield” icon to define the minimum clearance around the logo. Two (2) squares on the left
    and six (6) squares on the right.

    <img src={cobrandedLogoClearance1} alt="cobrandedLogoClearance1" />

    Ideal co-branded logo clearance in between the pipe. Use one-third (1/3) width size of the “shield” icon to determine the
    distance between the two logos separated with a pipe
