    ## Communicating the Brand - Tone & Manner
  </div>


  We aim to set TruShield as Canada’s most trusted small business insurer
  by speaking in a straight-forward, confident way. Our voice is smart,
  friendly and direct—the tone we use underlines the breadth and depth of
  our start-up and small business insurance expertise in a genuinely
  approachable and inviting manner. The information we offer may be
  sophisticated yet it is always easy to understand and feels warmly
  human—look for opportunities to delight—have fun, employ humour
  when appropriate, and avoid long drawn out copy or dry explanation
  whenever possible.
