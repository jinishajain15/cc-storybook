    # Brand Story
  </div>

  We understand that choosing to run a small business in Canada can be a path filled with unexpected twists and turns that will exhilarate and
  exasperate you at the same time. Having responsive, experienced partners and trusted mentors to provide guidance and support when you need it is
  essential for today’s entrepreneurs. When it comes to insurance, your business has its own specific set of risks and challenges. We’re here to guide
  you and provide easy-to-understand choices that are tailored to what makes your business special.
  **TruShield is here for you now and for what’s to come.**

    ## Communicating the Brand - Tone & Manner
  </div>


  We aim to set TruShield as Canada’s most trusted small business insurer
  by speaking in a straight-forward, confident way. Our voice is smart,
  friendly and direct—the tone we use underlines the breadth and depth of
  our start-up and small business insurance expertise in a genuinely
  approachable and inviting manner. The information we offer may be
  sophisticated yet it is always easy to understand and feels warmly
  human—look for opportunities to delight—have fun, employ humour
  when appropriate, and avoid long drawn out copy or dry explanation
  whenever possible.
