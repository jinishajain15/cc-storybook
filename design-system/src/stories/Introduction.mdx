    # The TruShield Insurance Design System
  </div>

    The TruShield Insuance Design System was created to help us build products for our customers more efficiently.
    The TruShield Design System was created to serve as the one source of truth for product teams working on TruShield products around the world.
    It includes everything from getting started guidance to Core Components meant to be used in each product.
    It makes it possible for product teams to create and develop quickly, consistently, and of high quality.
    To ensure that the system keeps changing to fit the demands of our designers, developers, and customers, our dedicated Design Operations team collaborates with the many product teams within TruShield.
